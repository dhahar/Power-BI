# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview

This dataset contains customer information from a bank, aimed at analyzing customer churn. The data includes demographic and financial details, used to predict which customers may exit the bank. Visualizations were created using Power BI to gain insights into customer behavior and churn patterns.

## Dataset Columns

- **RowNumber**: Index of the customer.
- **CustomerId**: Unique customer identifier.
- **Surname**: Customer’s surname.
- **CreditScore**: Customer’s credit score.
- **Geography**: Customer’s location (e.g., France, Spain, Germany).
- **Gender**: Customer’s gender.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance**: Customer’s bank account balance.
- **NumOfProducts**: Number of bank products the customer uses.
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **EstimatedSalary**: Estimated salary of the customer.
- **Exited**: Whether the customer exited the bank (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## Purpose

The dataset is used for:
- **Churn Prediction**: Identifying customers at risk of leaving the bank.
- **Behavior Analysis**: Understanding factors influencing customer decisions.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on demographic and financial data.

## Visualizations

Power BI was used to create various visualizations:
- **Churn Rate by Geography**: Bar chart to visualize churn across regions.
- **Customer Segmentation by Age and Balance**: Scatter plot to show the relationship between age, balance, and churn.
- **Exit Rate by Gender**: Pie chart to show the distribution of churn by gender.

## Insights

The visualizations provide insights into customer behavior, helping to identify patterns and factors contributing to churn. These insights can be used to improve customer retention strategies.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data visualization can aid in understanding customer churn and drive data-driven decisions for improving customer retention.
